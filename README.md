Short, logical game. At max it's 30 minutes gameplay. I just tested some things, this isn't something special.

## Controls
crouch - control

left mouse button/e - interact

g - drop item

You are faster when crouching in air.

Consistent jumping is making you go faster.

You can hold space to jump.
